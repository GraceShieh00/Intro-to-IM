**Here are some glimpses into my IM Project 2!**

Digital Input and Outputs + Reflection

After the first official introduction to Audrino, we were asked to create a circuit using the Arduino program that involves digital inputs and outputs. In simpler terms, we’re to direct commands from the computer to receive information from the sensors and react on the actuators. For my project, I created a circuit with three LEDs and three buttons, each with a different speed of blinking of light. 

Fascinated by the possibilities of the computer to execute well calculated commands, I drew inspiration from Chopin’s Fantasie Impromptu, a well known yet difficult piano piece. This piece demands two distinct, counterintuitive meters from the left and right hand (8 notes from the right hand and 6 from the left every beat), which often causes young pianists to struggle. To understand the difficulty of this, try tapping the table with your right hand 4 times every beat, then tapping your left hand 3 times in the same beat, without one hand influencing another. Now imaging doing this with different notes on the keyboard and working on phrasing, dynamics, and musicality simultaneously. Therefore, to help young pianists and amateurs understand the differences in rhythm, my project seeks to help them to visualize the meters in terms of light. 

When one presses the green button, the green light blinks quickly; when one presses the blue light, the yellow light blinks slowly. When pressing the red button, both lights blink, but at different, unequally divided speeds, allowing one to see the individual and combined effects of meters, or speed of notes, in music.  

This being my first time programming and second time creating with a circuit board, the project started roughly. For instance, I didn’t fully understand the language of arduino until some kind, generous classmates spent time reviewing and answering my questions, connecting what we learned in class with application. Another example is when I wanted to incorporate more than one button, yet didn’t know how to write them in the program, as my pushbutton and pushbutton2 commands kept receiving errors. I ended up searching online and reading responses from Arduino’s page as well as online videos, and simply enough, I needed to label pushbutton1 before I can label pushbutton2, and the issue thus resolved. A lot of errors and modifications occurred throughout, yet with the help of peers, online resources, and occasional spontaneous enlightenment, I’m able to grow in familiarity with the program and the board to create this project. I ended up enjoying the process a lot, and I look forward to more to come!
