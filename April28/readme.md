**Image**

This week, we're introduced to images and pixels on processing, along with some cool applications of working with images. For this assignment, we're asked to create something with an image. For me, I searched up an image of a girl under an umbrella, and instead of having rain droplets falling down from the sky, there are apples. Yes, it's raining apples!

Surprisingly, the code for this project is quite simple. First, I downloaded the image and used PImage to call and display it on the canvas. Then, I created a class called apples. This is very similar to a normal class we learned earlier, and the only difference is that this time, in display, I added another line that calls for the apple image to be displayed. This way, instead of circles or rectangles, it's the apples that are being displayed and shown falling from the sky. I think this is a really basic start to incorporating images and animation in processing, and I'm really excited to experiment with it further and see what's more to come!

Here's my video and image!
