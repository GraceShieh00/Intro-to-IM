**Final Project Draft**

For my final project, I would like to combine the animation and image skills we learned throughout semester to create a series of art pieces that in a way resembles an online interactive exhibition. For this interactive art piece, depending on where the mouse moves or which action it takes on the campus, different elements will be drawn on the canvas. Therefore, different movements along the canvas will result in the display of a variation of the final art pieces on the canvas. Refering back to previous assignments we've worked on throughout the semester, this project will be drawing inspiration from the assignment I created for the Object Assignment earlier in April. However, a bigger canvas will be created, with more variations of elements that can be add on to a canvas, and it will present the possibility of having more than one art pieces in the end.
