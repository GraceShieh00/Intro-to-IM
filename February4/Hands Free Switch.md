Light Triggered Piggy Bank

In class on Thursday, the class delved right into the wires, boards, lightbulbs, and some theories of electricity. We experimented, changed methods, and explored the numerous possibilities opened up by the simple tools in front of us. For our first project we were asked to light a lightbulb without using our hands. 
	
For my project, I wanted to create something that is not only visually appealing, but also applicable and useful in real life. As I wondered upon for ideas, my eyes landed on the pile of coins in my room. With credit cards and bills, it is sometimes easy for us to lose our coins, whether it be 50 cents, 1 dirhams, or 20 cents. As a response, I decided to create something that will promote good saving habits, and thus, I created a simple piggy bank design that would light up the light bulb as a positive reinforcement everytime one saves. 
	
The project started with a simple series circuit. As coins are metals, they’re able to connect two wires and allow the energy to flow freely through. Picture 1 is the first product, with wires on both ends of the piggy bank opening, allowing the light bulb to light up everytime a coin passes through and connects the wires. As I worked, I realized that by putting the wires below the surface, I was able to achieve the same result, but with a more aesthetic presentation. Picture 2 shows the model after such alteration.

As I proceed on experimenting with the circuits. I thought of the parallel circuits discussed in class, and decided to try building one. Picture 3 shows the improved, final version of the model, which is connected by 3 parallel circuits. Every circuit is tied to one piggy bank specifically designed to fit the size of a coin (20 cent, 50 cent, or 1 euro) with a colored light bulb connected. Therefore, when one deposits money in the containers, different values will trigger different colors of light reaction.

Throughout the process, I was surprised that I enjoyed making the model, and couldn’t stop thinking about how to improve upon them. This is my first time experimenting with wires and circuits, and I’m excited for future projects. For this design, further exploration could be on recycle bins and trash cans, cutlery storage in restaurants, and other places where clear organization and grouping would be beneficial, adding light and colors to these daily actions!
